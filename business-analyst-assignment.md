## Description
Create bash script to install Apache Airflow locally.
Write a DAG to process data from MongoDB to MySQL.

Write a SQL query to retrieve which group is the most active and which user is the most active.

## Context
To help you start we have prepared a dockerized MongoDb and a dockerized MySQL database.
You can find the docker-compose file in the root of this repository.
Start the docker containers with the following command:

The Mongo database is already populated with data. The MySQL database is empty.
