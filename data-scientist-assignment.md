## Description
1. Create bash script to install and run Apache Airflow locally.

3. Write a SQL query to retrieve which group is the most active and which user is the most active.
4. Make a pull request containing the bash script, DAG and SQL query, and assign the PR to us.

## Context
To help you start we have prepared a dockerized MongoDb and a dockerized MySQL database.
You can find the docker-compose file in the root of this repository.
Start the docker containers with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The Mongo database is already populated with data. The MySQL database is empty.

Happy coding! ðŸ¤“
