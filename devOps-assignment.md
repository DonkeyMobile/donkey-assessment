# Donkey assessment â€” DevOps

Welcome to this assessment.

## Description

Set up a simple backend API to let users create, read, update, and delete a post on a timeline.
This post contains a date and a description.

1.	Provide Infrastructure as Code to deploy the API in AWS.
2.	Secure the API with an identity provider (e.g., Cognito).
3.	Add a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the service.
4.	Add basic monitoring (logs, metrics, alarms).

## Requirements
1. AWS IaC (SAM / CDK / Terraform / CloudFormation)
2. Node.js with Typescript
3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions / AWS Pipeline)
4. Monitoring (CloudWatch, Datadog, or similar)
5. Must be possible to run locally, including the database and IP.
6. You do not have to actually deploy the application to AWS. But everything should be in place to do so easily.

## Bonus:
â€¢	Add a small frontend

Happy automating! ðŸ¤–
